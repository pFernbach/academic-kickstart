# Biography

My name is Pierre Fernbach, I have a PhD in robotics and I am currently in a postdoctoral research position at the LAAS-CNRS lab, in the [GEPETTO team](http://projects.laas.fr/gepetto/index.php). 
My research interest focus on motion and contact planning for locomotion of legged robots in multi-contact scenario.
