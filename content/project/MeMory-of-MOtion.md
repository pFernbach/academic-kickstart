# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "The project Memmo aims to solve the problem of generating complex movements for arbitrary robots with arms and legs interacting in a dynamic environment in real-time by 1) relying on massive off-line caching of pre-computed optimal motions that are 2) recovered and adapted online to new situations with real-time tractable model predictive control and where 3) all available sensor modalities are exploited for feedback control going beyond the mere state of the robot for more robust behaviors. Memmo will develop a unified yet tractable approach to motion generation for complex robots with arms and legs."
