abstract = "This paper addresses the problem of fault diagnosis in discrete-event system. The system under investigation is modelled as a labelled Petri net. We first propose an equivalent encoding of the classical diagnoser with the help of a CPN diagnoser. We then apply this encoding to define a modular CPN diagnoser. "
